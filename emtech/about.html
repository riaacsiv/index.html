  <h1>💬 About Us | LittleHomesOfHope.org</h1>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>At <strong>Little Homes Of Hope</strong>, we are a community of volunteers, advocates, and mentors dedicated to ending youth homelessness. Since our beginning, our mission has been simple yet powerful — to reach out, listen, and help young people build brighter, safer futures.</p>

  <p>We believe that every child deserves a home, an education, and a chance to dream.</p>

  <h2>🌍 Our Story</h2>
  <p>Homelessness is not just a lack of shelter — it’s the absence of safety, support, and belonging. We started with a small group of volunteers who walked the streets, offering food, blankets, and a listening ear to kids in need.</p>

  <p>Over the years, that small act of kindness grew into a nationwide effort — one built on compassion, hope, and love. Today, we continue to serve communities across the country, one youth at a time.</p>

  <h2>💕 Our Mission</h2>
  <p>To end youth homelessness by connecting young people with caring adults, life-saving resources, and long-term support. We aim to guide them from crisis to stability — and ultimately, to independence.</p>

  <h2>💡 Our Values</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Compassion:</strong> We lead with kindness and empathy.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect:</strong> Every story and every person matters.</li>
    <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> We help youth discover their strength and potential.</li>
    <li><strong>Community:</strong> Together, we can create lasting change.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>👥 Meet Our Team</h2>
  <p>Our team is made up of passionate volunteers, social workers, and mentors who believe in second chances. Each one of us is here to listen, guide, and walk beside the youth we serve — every step of the way.</p>

  <h2>❤️ Join Our Journey</h2>
  <p>We’re not just fighting homelessness — we’re building hope. Whether you volunteer, donate, or share our story, you’re helping us make a difference.</p>
